# SNRcat-interactiveplot

Script to produce interactive html plot where you can zoom and pan in the galactic plane to explore the population of known supernova remnant (SNRs) from radio surveys.
When overing your mouse over a disk, a pop-up window shows a list of information (e.g. age, dist, whatever).

In this code the age and distances are faked but can be linked to any database.

The interactive part is handled by the mpld3 module described here:
